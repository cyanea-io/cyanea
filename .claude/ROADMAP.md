# Cyanea Roadmap

> From zero to the best Rust bioinformatics ecosystem + federated "GitHub for Life Sciences"

---

## Philosophy

1. **Foundations first** — Build world-class Rust libraries before/alongside the platform
2. **Federation first** — Build the distributed architecture early, not as an afterthought
3. **Artifacts over files** — Typed, versioned scientific objects with lineage
4. **Prove the loop** — MVP must demonstrate: create → publish → discover → derive → credit
5. **Community is the moat** — Social mechanics and trust are as important as features
6. **Ship early, iterate fast** — Get feedback from real users

---

## Two Tracks

Cyanea development runs on **two parallel tracks**:

```
                    2026                           2027                    2028
         Q1    Q2    Q3    Q4    Q1    Q2    Q3    Q4    Q1
         ├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
LABS     │████████████████████████│     │     │     │     │  ← ALL COMPLETE (Q1 2026)
         │ 13 crates, 659+ tests │ GPU │     │     │     │  ← GPU backends pending HW
         ├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
PLATFORM │ P0  │ P1  │ P2  │ P3  │ P4  │ P5  │ P6  │ P7  │  ← Elixir/Phoenix
         │found│ mvp │ fed │comm │life │repro│integ│scale│
         └─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
```

**Labs status:** All 13 crates are fully implemented ahead of schedule. Remaining work is CUDA/Metal GPU backends (need hardware SDKs), SIMD vectorization (need profiling), and publishing to crates.io/npm/PyPI. Platform development can now consume Labs directly.

## Non-Goals (Deliberate Exclusions)

### Cyanea Labs

| Non-Goal | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Rewrite every tool | Focus on core primitives first |
| Support all GPU vendors day one | CUDA + Metal first, ROCm later |
| 100% parity with established tools | Focus on common cases, iterate |
| Build workflow orchestration | Provide building blocks, not engine |
| Windows GPU support (initial) | Focus on Linux/macOS first |

### Cyanea Platform

| Non-Goal | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Mobile native apps | PWA is sufficient |
| Sequence editor | Use SnapGene, Benchling, etc. |
| Full LIMS replacement | Focus on sharing, not inventory |
| Workflow orchestration engine | Wrap existing (Nextflow, etc.) |
| Real-time collaborative editing | Too complex, defer |
| Perfect ontology coverage | Iterate based on usage |
| Central blob storage for everything | Support pointers/remote refs |
| Automated compliance | Provide tools, not magic |

## Open Design Questions

Decisions to make as we build (Claude Code should propose options):

### Cyanea Labs

| Question | Phase | Considerations |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| GPU abstraction strategy | L4 | Custom trait vs wgpu vs backend-specific |
| SIMD approach | L2 | std::simd (nightly) vs simdeez vs hand-written |
| WASM async model | L5 | Blocking + Workers vs async/await |
| Error handling crate | L0 | thiserror vs anyhow vs custom |
| Python binding style | L1+ | Thin bindings vs Pythonic wrappers |
| Workspace vs multi-repo | L0 | Single Cargo workspace vs separate repos |
| Minimum Rust version | L0 | Stable vs nightly (for SIMD, etc.) |
| Benchmarking datasets | L1+ | Synthetic vs real public datasets |

### Cyanea Platform

| Question | Phase | Considerations |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Federation protocol | P1-2 | Custom, ActivityPub-inspired, OCI-like? |
| Artifact schema strictness | P1 | Permissive MVP vs strict validation? |
| Global ID format | P1 | `cyanea://org/project/artifact@version`? |
| Event sourcing depth | P1 | Full ES vs hybrid approach? |
| Manifest format | P1-2 | JSON, protobuf, custom? |
| Sync conflict resolution | P2 | Immutable = no conflicts, but metadata? |
| Key management | P2 | HSM, platform-managed, user-managed? |
| Search federation | P2 | Centralized index vs distributed query? |
| Compute for repro runs | P5 | Self-hosted only vs managed option? |

## Principles

### Cyanea Labs

1. **Performance is a feature** — If it's not fast, it won't be used
2. **WASM-first thinking** — Every library should work in the browser
3. **GPU is not optional** — Number-crunching needs acceleration
4. **Coherent APIs** — Consistent patterns across all crates
5. **Zero magic** — Transparent, documented algorithms
6. **Interop matters** — Python, JS, Elixir bindings are first-class
7. **Benchmark everything** — Claims require evidence

### Cyanea Platform

1. **Federation is not optional** — Every feature should work in standalone and federated mode
2. **Artifacts have identity** — Content-addressed, globally referenceable, typed
3. **Lineage is sacred** — Never break the provenance chain
4. **Community > customers** — Researchers first, revenue second
5. **Open by default** — Make sharing easy, private when needed
6. **Design matters** — Scientists deserve beautiful tools
7. **Ship and iterate** — Perfect is the enemy of shipped
